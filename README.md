# cvrpsep

This is my "fork" of the CVRPSEP package for separation algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem which is hosted at https://econ.au.dk/research/researcher-websites/jens-lysgaard/cvrpsep/.

In the master branch, the only change is to rename the source code to all lower case convention (rename.sh). The original code was mixed and caused some issues on some hosts. Otherwise, the master branch is a copy of the original source. Subsequent branches will include contributed fixes and improvements.
