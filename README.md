**Archived project: This project is no longer under active development and was archived on 2024-07-23.**

This is my "fork" of the CVRPSEP package for separation algorithms for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem which is hosted at https://econ.au.dk/research/researcher-websites/jens-lysgaard/cvrpsep/.

In the initial commit, the only change is to rename the source code to all lower case convention (rename.sh). The original code was mixed and caused some issues on some hosts. Otherwise, the initial commit is a copy of the original source. Subsequent commits will include contributed fixes and improvements.
